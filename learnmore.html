          <h1>Ecosystems that need to survive</h1>
          <p>They may not be household names, like the Amazon rainforest or the Great Barrier Reef. But these forests, grasslands, savannas, and other ecosystems are just as vital to the health of our planet. They support an incredible range of plants and animals, as well as millions of people and their communities.</p>

          <h4>Cerrado savanna</h4>
          <p>When it comes to forests, the Amazon rainforest usually grabs the spotlight. But the nearby Cerrado, a wooded grassland covering more than 20% of Brazil, is equally important. It’s the world’s most biodiverse savanna, home to an astonishing 5% of the Earth’s plants and animals. Jaguars, giant anteaters, maned wolves, and armadillos live within this ecosystem, which also provides essential services to local communities and stores immense amounts of carbon in the ground.</p>

          <p>In recent decades, agircultural expansion for beef and soy production has driven rapid deforestation across the region. As grasslands are plowed up, they release an estimated 250 million tons of greenhouse gases annually—the equivalent of burning 28 billion gallons of gasoline.</p>

          <h4>Forests of eastern Australia</h4>
          <p>Though Australia is mostly desert, the tropical and temperate forests, savannas, and shrublands along the country’s eastern coast are some of the most biologically diverse regions on Earth, with thousands of plant species and more than 150 species of mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and birds found nowhere else.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, the continent’s forests are now being cleared at a rapid pace for livestock and agriculture, making it one of the world’s most at-risk deforestation fronts. But that’s not just bad news for trees. When trees and other vegetation are removed, sediment, fertilizer, and pesticides run off into the nearby Great Barrier Reef, where they smother coral reefs and pollute fragile marine ecosystems. Land-clearing also drives climate change, leading to rising ocean temperatures and coral bleaching.</p>

          <h4>Greater Mekong region</h4>
          <p>Few places on earth are as biodiverse or ecologically important as the Greater Mekong region. Stretching from the Tibetan plateau to the shores of Vietnam, this spectacular ecosystem features an abundance of rare wildlife, mangrove forests that protect coastal communities, and the largest combined tiger habitat in the world. It also supports the world’s largest inland fishery, an essential source of food and income for the river basin's 70 million people.</p>

          <p>When the Black Rhino Range Expansion Project began the rhinos were originally airlifted in nets. Then in 2012, project leader Dr Jacques Flamand saw photos of rhino in Namibia being airlifted while strapped by the ankles.</p>

          <p>He suggested that this method be tried during the next project translocation.</p>

          <p>Since then, this has been the technique of choice for moving rhinos out of tricky terrain—but only for short stretches until they can be loaded onto a truck. They are usually airborne for 10 minutes or less.</p>

          <p>The advantage of this airlift technique is that fewer people are needed on the ground because the rhino does not have to be rolled onto a net. This saves time and is kinder to the rhino which is unconscious for a much shorter period.</p>
